		<h3> Over the years I've done a lot of sports </h3>
		<p class = col-12> I've played tennis, swam, ran, competed in triathlons and now most recently, I row for my school. As you can see, most of the sports I do/did are pain sports. </p>
		<br>
		<h4 class = "tabbed"> Here's the breakdown </h4>

		<div class = "col-lg-3 col-sm-6 odd">
			<h4 class = "centered"> Rowing </h4>
			<br>
			<ul class = "right-al">
				<li>Brutal sport, probably ties with running as being the physically most painful sport in my opinion
				</li>
				<li>
					Correct me if I'm wrong, but one of the only team based, pain sports. I think out of everything I've done, rowing is my favorite for this reason.
				</li>
				<li>
					Caloric intake - med to high
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class = "col-lg-3 col-sm-6 even">
			<h4 class = "centered"> Running </h4>
			<br>
			<ul class = "right-al">
				<li>Also a brutal sport, if you're legs are anything like mine you can expect shin splints and if you're really unluck a stress fracutre
				</li>
				<li>
					Kinda team based but more of a solitary sport
				</li>
				<li>
					Caloric intake - high
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class = "col-lg-3 col-sm-6 odd">
			<h4 class = "centered"> Swimming</h4>
			<br>
			<ul class = "right-al">
				<li> Out of my experience, not the most painful, but that's probably becasue I did it for a long time. Definetely most taxing on the lungs
				</li>
				<li>
					Probably more individual than running becasue you're literally staring at a black line. But relays are fun. Burn't out sophomore year of highschool cause I switched teams and they sucked
				</li>
				<li>
					Caloric intake - med to high
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class = "col-lg-3 col-sm-6 even">
			<h4 class = "centered"> Triathlons</h4>
			<br>
			<ul class = "right-al">
				<li>The grand whammy, swimming, biking and running. I personally enjoy this a ton. Gives you lots of time to think about life
				</li>
				<li>
					Ultimate individual sport
				</li>
				<li>
					Caloric intake - uber high depending on volume
				</li>
			</ul>
