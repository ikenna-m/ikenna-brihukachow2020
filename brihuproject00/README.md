# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
In this webproject there are 5 html files. There is index1.html which is the landing page and then vegan.html, doggo.html, professional.html and sport.html all of which can be accessed from the landing page. Each page has a part about me - dogs, professional interests, veganism, and athletics. There are 3 stylesheets - 2 created with sass and one normal one. All the other files are picture images that are included in the site. I definitely could have been more organized but I think that will come with more project experience.

This was a great project to get started with web dev, thank you!
