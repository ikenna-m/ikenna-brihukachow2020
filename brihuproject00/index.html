	    					Some of my favorite sports are rowing and running. I also swam competitevly for 15 years, but after switching to a team that only cared for its prize swimmers, burn't out in a month and quit the competitive swim scene. I moved into running after swimming and ran track & cross country all through highschool. At Yale, I row for lightweight crew and also compete in half-ironmans during off season.
