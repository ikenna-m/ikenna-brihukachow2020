# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

For this first project, I used the requirements as a baseline to make a personal website. Here, I shared a little bit about me and the interests that came to my mind first. My index is the home page introducing myself and the content I discuss. Each of the other html pages highlight an interest of mine - quotes, veganism, afrobeats and kombucha. I have my stylesheet made in scss, along with the compiled css and mapping files. Additionally, I made an images folder, from which I source the images I make use of in my pages. 

This site was made in pure fun and I hope it is enjoyable to go through! Thanks :)
