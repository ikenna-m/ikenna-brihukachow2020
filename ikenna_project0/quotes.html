            <div><bdi>כל העולם כולו גשר צר מאוד והעקר לא לפחד כלל</bdi> is one said by the Rabi Nachman of Breslov. It means, "The whole world in its entirety is a very narrow bridge, and the main thing is to not have fear at all." There's a really pretty tune that is associated with it and I really like the imagery of this one!
