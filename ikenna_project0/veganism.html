            <h1>Veganism</h1>
            I like vegan food! and I feel bad for animals that would be used in order to make animal products. I also find in myself a strong revulsion for a lot of them. Also makes kashrut a lot easier.

            Succinct list of reasons
            <ol>
                <li>I prefer to keep kosher in as best a way I can</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="wentin">animal products present some of the most stringent considerations that I don't necessarily want to deal with, especially when it comes to availability that varies on where I am</li>
                        <li class="wentin">there's a concept of avoiding tsa'ar ba'alei á¸¥ayim (suffering of living creatures) that is violated in the modern animal product industries</li>
                        <li class="wentin">there's a religious basis for the idea that people were not meant to eat animals and that the practice arose as divine concession to human desire... basically for many religious people: lowkey your religion ain't espousing constant meat consumption</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Health-wise, I don't see dairy and meat as helpful to me, since they promote inflammation without much benefit that cannot be derived elsewhere</li>
                <li>I don't have the guts to kill an animal</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="wentin">There's an idea of not benefitting from something I could not do myself in theory</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>the poor babies!</li>
            </ol>
